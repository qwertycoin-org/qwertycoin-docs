A user must generate a wallet address in order to use QWC blockchain from available QWC wallets(software). There are various  types of wallets you can choose including [paper wallet](https://Paper-Wallet.md), [CLI wallet](Using-CLI-Wallet.md), [GUI wallet](Using-GUI-Wallet.md), [Web wallet](Using-Web-Wallet.md) and [Mobile wallet](Using-Mobile-Wallet.md).

We recommend making a paper wallet so that you can start receiving funds, and later import them into a CLI, GUI, Web and Mobile wallets.
