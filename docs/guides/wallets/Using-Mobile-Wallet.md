title: Using Mobile Wallet
---

The Qwertycoin mobile wallet is currently only available on Android. The iOS version is complete but Apple is making it difficult to add it to the App Store. So we advise iOS users use the [web wallet](https://myqwertycoin.org) for now.

## Installing the mobile wallet app
* Go to the Google Play store and search for Qwertycoin wallet. Or you can click [this link](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.qwertycoin.wallet) to bring you there.

* Once you are there click the 'Install' button to add the app to your phone.

## Creating a new wallet
* Click on the newly installed Qwertycoin wallet app and it will bring you to this home screen:

* Next click the 'Create a wallet' button to begin. You will be prompted to create a password. Enter and confirm the password then press 'Use this password' to continue.

* Now you will need to save your private keys. Write these down and save them in a safe place. **Do not share these with anyone!!** Once you have written them down click the "I have written my seed phrase down button" and then the 'I understand. Continue.' button to finish.
