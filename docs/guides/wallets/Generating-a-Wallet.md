## Paper Wallet

The main purpose of a paper wallet is to quickly create a wallet to start receiving funds.

You will not be able to spend or send your funds to other people until you set up a CLI, GUI or Web Wallet.

To view a guide on how to make a paper wallet, you can go [here](Paper-Wallet.md).
## Classic (CLI Wallet)

The CLI Wallet, is a multi-platform program (Win/Linux/Mac) that requires you to enter commands for it to work and you cannot use your mouse. However, it is currently the most stable and gets the newest updates first.

If you would like to use CLI Wallet, you can check out [this guide](Using-CLI-Wallet.md).
## Graphical Wallet (GUI Wallet)

If you prefer to use a GUI wallet, there are currently three which are being maintained:
1. [Windows](https://qwertycoin.org/get/gui/latest/windows64)
3. [Apple MacOS](https://qwertycoin.org/get/gui/latest/macos)
4. [Linux](https://qwertycoin.org/get/gui/latest/linux)
