title: Paper Wallet
---

The main purpose of a paper wallet is to quickly create a wallet to start receiving funds. But you won't be able to spend or send your funds until you setup a CLI, GUI or Web Wallet.

## Generate wallet
* Go [here](https://explorer.qwertycoin.org/#paperwallet) to go to the paper wallet generator. You will see something like this:

* To generate the wallet, click the 'Generate' button at the top of the page. A new wallet will be generated for you.

* Once generated you will be given your Qwertycoin address, mnemonic seed, legacy GUI keys, view keys and spend keys.

***Make sure to copy all this information down and keep it in a safe place!***

***Do not share your keys with anyone!*** If you do they will have access to your funds.

You can safely give out your wallet address to receive funds.
