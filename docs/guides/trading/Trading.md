## Choosing an exchange
Choosing which exchange to trade on can be a difficult task. Luckily there are only four to choose from at the moment for Qwertycoin. When choosing an exchange you need to look at these things:

#### Is the exchange reputable
The first thing when choosing an exchange is to make sure the exchange is reputable. When you use an exchange you are trusting them with your funds. One of the best ways to see is an exchange is reputable is to do a quick Google search and see what users have to say.

#### How secure is the exchange
Security is just as important as the reputability of an exchange. Look for exchanges with strict security measures such as proper verification and two factor authentication (2FA). Also do a quick Google search to see if an exchange has been hacked.

#### What are the payment options
Different exchanges generally accept different payment options. Some only accept cryptocurrency deposits while others accept credit cards and wire transfers. If you plan on exchanging crypto for fiat, make sure and choose an exchange that offers that option.  

#### What are the fees
Generally you want to choose an exchange with as little of fees as possible. Each exchange has their own set of fees and fee structure so it would be a good idea to do some research into the exchange you plan on using.

#### How liquid is the exchange
Look for an exchange with higher liquidity, which means there are lots of buyers and sellers. Trading on an exchange with high liquidity means that your trade will complete much quicker and you can generally make a trade that's higher or lower than you would like. You can find an exchange's liquidity by doing a quick Google search.

#### What are the trading pairs
Choosing a trading pair is more of a preference. Bitcoin and Ethereum are usually the most used pairs. Choose an exchange that aligns with your intentions. If you plan on only trading crypto to fiat then choose an exchange that offers that. You can see the trading pairs available for Qwertycoin at the beginning of this article.   

**IMPORTANT NOTE - The [BiteBTC](https://bitebtc.com/) exchange has reports of users having issues withdrawing their funds. So take that into consideration when choosing an exchange.**
