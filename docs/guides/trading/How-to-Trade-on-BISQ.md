### Notifications (optional)

## Funding Bisq
**Funding Bisq before any trades is optional as it helps to simplify the trading process. You can fund it later during the trade if you like**

There are two options to fund your account. You can send Bitcoin directly to your built-in BTC wallet or you can fund it using fiat as shown in the 'Buying Bitcoin with Fiat' tutorial below.

### Send BTC
* You can fund your wallet with Bitcoin by going to the 'Funds' tab and sending Bitcoin to the Bitcoin address shown there. You should send at least 0.01 BTC because Bisq requires buyers and sellers to post a security deposit for every trade to help combat fraud.

* Once you have funded your trade wallet a 'Review: Take offer to buy bitcoin' button will appear. Click it and Bisq will give you the details of your trade you're about to take. If it all looks good hit the 'Confirm: Take offer to buy bitcoin' button.

* Once the offer is taken, it is time to pay the seller. A popup with the sellers details will appear. Pay the seller through the agreed upon payment method. After your payment is sent, click the 'Payment started' button.

* Once the seller gets the payment then will mark it as received. Bisq will then release the Bitcoin you bought along with the security deposit.
