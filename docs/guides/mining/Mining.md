Mining is essentially the process of using your computer to help verify and secure a cryptocurrency network, in our case, it is the Qwertycoin network. By doing this, you will be rewarded with some Qwertycoin.

If you want to learn about cryptocurrencies, mining is a great place to start!

## How to Mine Qwertycoin?

**Please note**: Unfortunately because of some bad people using mining software in malware, most antivirus software will detect the programs below as unsafe.

It is **likely** you will need to add exceptions and exclusions to your antivirus software in order to make things work properly.

Unless you know what you are doing, please **only** download from the links below.

There are currently a few different ways in which you can start mining Qwertycoin:

## 1. [XMR-Stak](https://github.com/fireice-uk/xmr-stak)

XMR-Stak is a unified miner, which means the same program will be used to mine with both your CPU and your GPU. It will automatically detect your hardware and adjust the settings accordingly.

Please follow [this guide](XMR-Stak) to start mining Qwertycoin with XMR-Stak.

If you're on Linux, check [this guide](XMR-Stak-Linux).
## 2. [XMRig](https://github.com/xmrig/xmrig)

XMRig is a little bit different to XMR-Stak, you need to download a CPU and GPU miner separately and run two separate instances in your computer. One will use your CPU and the other one will use your GPU.

Please follow [this guide](XMRIG) to start mining Qwertycoin with XMRig.
## 3. Cloud Mining

## 4. SBC/Raspberry PI Mining
